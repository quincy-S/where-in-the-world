## About the project

This is my solution to the REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of this challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries V3 API] to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## Built with

I used the following tools for this project:

- React JS
- Styled-components
- Ionicons
- REST Countries V3 API
- Google Fonts
